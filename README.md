# Toxicity_Detection_Game_DAT255
This app analyzes user comments and detects toxicity categories 

## To run The demo: 
Visit :
[Visit: Toxicity Detection Game](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TamerDeen/Toxicity_Detection_Game_DAT255)

## This project contains several models. 
These models were trained until the best model was achieved. The best model was published on Spaces.

# How to run the website: 
1. Download the Spaces_Huggingface_rep folder
2. Run the requirement liberies which in requirements.txt 
3. Run the code in python environment by run app.py


# How to run the model and evalutions:
1. You do not need to run all models, just the best which is 6th_Model_as5th_With_Attention_Loss_top_training, unless you want to see the whole process
2. The folder contains the folling files:
    1. 09_01 file is the traning file 
    2. Evaluation_and_testing.ipynb file for evalut the model
    3. dataset_splits3.npz file is the dataset which is cleaned and splitted 
    4. last_model.keras file is the model 
    5. vectorizer_vocabulary.pkl is the vectorizer
    6. gradio2.ipynb file is the Gradio code to create interFace for the project.
3. Run and test what you want
